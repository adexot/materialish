# Roadmap

These are future improvements we plan for Materialish.

- **Improved accessibility**. Using ARIA attributes and following a specification, such as WCAG AA, to ensure that this library
  is accessible.
  
- **Interaction examples**. Now that we are nearing completeness for the "base" components, it is time for us to focus
  our attention on interaction components. For the functionality that we are looking for, many of these require the
  completion of the React Over library, which we are actively developing.
  
- **More guides with usage examples**. We plan to provide code samples and written guides to demonstrate common patterns
  built using Materialish.
  
- **Improved icons**. Material provides different variations of icons, such as rounded or outline. We plan to enhance
  the icons that we currently output to support these variations via a prop.
  
- **Upgraded documentation**. Right now, the docs are in an MVP state. We're planning huge improvements to make them
  more useful, such as multiple code examples per component, and more ways to interact with components before you install
  Materialish in your project.
