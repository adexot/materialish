# Introduction

Materialish is a collection of React components that are loosely inspired by
[Material Design](https://material.io/).

## Getting Started

We encourage newcomers to start off by reading the [philosophy](/philosophy) of the library.
Understanding the library's goals will help you set your expectations about what Materialish is,
and just as importantly, what it is not.

Once you have read about the project's philosophy, you are ready to install it.

## Installation

Install Materialish using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```
npm install materialish
```

or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```
yarn add materialish
```

## Prerequisites

You are responsible for loading [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) in whatever
way makes the most sense for your application.

Aside from that, your application needs to be able to render React components and import CSS files.
